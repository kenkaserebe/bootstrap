# Bootstrap AWS - Terraform State Backend

This repository contains Terraform configuration to bootstrap an AWS S3 bucket for storing Terraform state files. It creates a secure, versioned, and encrypted S3 bucket with all public access blocked.

## Purpose

When managing infrastructure with Terraform, a remote backend (like S3) is recommended to store state files. This bootstrap step creates the S3 bucket that will be used as the backend for your actual infrastructure deployments.

## Features

- Creates an S3 bucket with a globally unique name (provided by you)
- Enables **bucket versioning** - recover from accidental deletions or corruption
- Enforces **server-side encryption** (AES-256) - protects sensitive data
- Blocks **all public access** - ensures bucket is private
- Uses local Terraform state for the bootstrap itself (no backend configuration)

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (v1.0+)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with credentials (or IAM role/permissions)
- Appropriate AWS permissions to create S3 buckets and modify their settings

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/kenkaserebe/bootstrap.git
cd bootstrap/aws


#### 2. Configure variables

Create a terraform.tfvars file (or use environment variables) with the required inputs:

hcl
region      = "us-east-1"
bucket_name = "your-unique-state-bucket-name"

Important: The bucket_name must be globally unique across all of AWS


### 3. Initialize and apply

bash
terraform init
terraform plan      # review what will be created
terraform apply     # create the bucket


### 4. Outputs

After apply, Terraform will output:

bucket_name - name of the created bucket
bucket_arn - ARN of the bucket

Use these values when configuring your other Terraform projects' backend:

hcl
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        bucket          = "your-unique-state-bucket-name"
        key             = "path/to/your/terraform.tfstate"
        region          = "us-east-1"
        encrypt         = true
        use_lockfile    = true         # Enables s3 native locking (Terraform 1.11+)
    }
}


#### Variables

Name            Description                             Type            Required

region          AWS region where the bucket             string          yes
                will be created
        
bucket_name     Globally unique S3 bucket name          string          yes


#### Outputs

Name                        Description

bucket_name                 Name of the created S3 bucket

bucket_arn                  ARN of the created S3 bucket


##### Cleanup

If you no longer need the bucket (e.g. during development/testing), you can destroy it:

bash
terraform destroy


Note: force_destroy = true is set on the bucket, so it will delete even if it contains objects. For production, you should remove this flag and manage deletion carefully.


##### Security

- Bucket encryption is enabled with AES-256
- Public access is fully blocked.
- Versioning protects against accidental state loss.
